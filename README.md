## Folder Contents / Tree 

### Intro

This repo is keeping scanned document in different resolutions, each resolution in a separate directory:

- DPI_1200 - This folder contains very high resolution scans 

- DPI_600 - Also high reslution scans, 600dpi each

There is only one document everywhere, it's available in non-compressed, compressed and, very high-compressed variant on each directory. 

You should choose which variant to pick/download depending on the quality of the picture (Dary's portrait on the first diplom page) and on the file size.
